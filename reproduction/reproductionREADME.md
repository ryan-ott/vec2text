# Vec2Text Reproduction
This folder contains the scripts used to reproduce the results in the paper "Text Embeddings Reveal (Almost) As Much As Text", as well as results, analysis notebooks and other files generated during the reproduction process.

## Getting Started
We suggest creating a new virtual environment to run the scripts. To do so, run the following commands:
```bash
python -m venv v2t-env
source v2t-env/bin/activate
```

Then, install the required packages:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Running Experiments
#### In-Domain Reproduction
To reproduce the in-domain experiments, run the following command:
```bash
placholder
```

#### Out-of-Domain Reproduction
To reproduce the out-of-domain experiments, run the following command:
```bash
placholder
```

#### Dataset Similarity Analysis
To verify our readings of the dataset similarity, run the following command:
```bash
placholder
```

#### Sequence Length Experiment
To reproduce the sequence length experiment, run the following command:
